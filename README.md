# BD Pokedex

A Boot.dev project.

Explore the Pokémon world, catch the Pokémon and learn more about them.
The program written in TypeScript uses [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to get data about locations and Pokémon.
It uses [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) for the user interface.
